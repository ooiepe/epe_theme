<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The Ocean Observatories Initiative is a networked infrastructure of science-driven sensor systems to measure the physical, chemical, geological and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor as well as the overlying atmosphere, providing a fully integrated system collecting data on coastal, regional and global scales.  The OOI will put these real-time ocean observing data in the hands of a vast user community including scientists, educators, and the public.  </p>

<p>Tools in the Ocean Education Portal provide easy access for the development of educational data visualizations and translation of OOI science into pedagogical resources such as concept maps and online lessons.
