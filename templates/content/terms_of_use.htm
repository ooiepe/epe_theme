<h3>1	 Purpose</h3>
<p>The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) program, funded by the National Science Foundation, is an interactive, distributed, and integrated network of ocean infrastructure supporting science-driven sensor systems to enable long-term, complex, interdisciplinary ocean investigations. This OOI User Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) pertain to the definition, collection, distribution, and use of all data and materials collected and produced by the OOI. It was established in accordance with accepted domestic and international best practices in marine and atmospheric science.  The purpose of this document is to present the OOI User T&Cs.</p>

<h3>2	Definitions</h3>
<p>"OOI data" is defined as data or product(s) produced by or resulting from instruments connected to the OOI system, the OOI infrastructure, associated metadata, and any additional observations made for the purpose of quality control and assurance. </p>
<p>A product is defined as an item or information that is derived from observational data through any kind of computation or processing. This includes aggregation, analysis, modeling, or visualization processes.</p>

<p>An OOI data "User" is defined as an individual, group or organization that receives or uses OOI data for any reason. </p> 

<h3>3	Data Sources</h3>
<p>OOI data emanate primarily from three sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core</strong> - instruments that are part of the OOI infrastructure construction</li>
  <li><strong>Ship-based</strong> - calibration and validation data collected during installation/recovery/maintenance cruises to the sites of OOI infrastructure</li>
  <li><strong>Project Specific</strong> - instruments that are attached to or use the OOI infrastructure and are owned and operated by persons/organizations other than the OOI Program Office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of source, all data produced as a consequence of the OOI infrastructure are considered OOI data and are governed by this data policy and T&Cs.</p>


<h3>4	User Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>This User Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL), program director of the Ocean Observatories Initiative ("OOI"), having a mailing address of 1201 New York Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20001 and the OOI Data User (User). This Document and OOI Web site(s) ("Site(s)") were developed by COL. By using the Web site(s) and/or downloading materials, you agree to the Terms and Conditions set forth in this document (the Agreement). If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, please promptly exit the Site.  COL reserves the right to modify the Terms and Conditions at its discretion at any time. Such modifications will be effective when posted.</p>
<p>COL provides and the User hereby accepts the OOI Data subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Attribution</strong>. The OOI Program requires an acknowledgement (in publications, conference papers, etc.) from those who use data from OOI, its tools or software. Users are required to specifically acknowledge the National Science Foundation and the COL OOI Program Office when core data/infrastructure is used and individual researchers, groups, or organizations when project specific data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Data Use</strong>. The COL OOI Program is not responsible for the use of the data it provides.</li>
<li><strong>Dependability</strong>. The reliability, quality and completeness of data obtained through OOI are intended to be used in an education or research context. It is assumed that outages and errors can occur and are dealt with by the users of the data. <strong>These data and software are not for use in operational or decision-making settings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Accuracy and quality</strong>. COL makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the data provided are accurate.  However, there may be no Quality Control (QC) performed on data acquired and provided through the OOI program, and there may be no Quality Assurance (QA) provided on information on those data sets. If QC/QA is performed, it is described in the metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Provision of Data</strong>. The OOI program both produces and through collaborations within the geosciences community, gains access to data sets which may be redistributed either directly or indirectly at no cost. With regard to data distribution, all Users must comply with any applicable U.S. export laws and regulations. </li>
<li><strong>Provision of Software</strong>. Software supported and distributed by OOI are available by downloading from the OOI web site. </li>
